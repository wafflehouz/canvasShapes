# Canvas Shapes Game

A simple and fun browser-based game designed for young children to learn mouse interaction. Colorful shapes bounce around the screen, and the player can interact with them in two different modes.

## How to Play

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

1.  **Choose a Mode:** From the start screen, select either "Explode Mode" or "Add Mode".

3.  **Play Again:** When you win, a message will appear with a button to play again.
